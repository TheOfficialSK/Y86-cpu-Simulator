# Y86-Simulator

This Y-86 Simulator is an educational project that simulates a Y-86 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) processor in C-99. The project aims to help users understand the inner workings of a processor, differences between Y-86 and x86 ISAs, and get hands-on experience with assembly language programming.

## Overview

The Y-86 Simulator provides a comprehensive environment to experiment with Y-86 assembly language programming, including loading and executing programs, inspecting the processor state, and debugging. It supports a subset of the x86 ISA, making it easier to understand and learn compared to the full x86 ISA.

## Features
- Parsing and loading of Y-86 assembly code
- Execution of Y-86 programs
- Inspection of processor state and memory contents
- Debugging functionality with step-by-step execution
- Support for various command-line options to customize the simulation
- Detailed documentation and examples to help users get started


## Differences between Y-86 and x86 ISAs
Y-86 is a simpler version of the x86 ISA, designed for educational purposes. Some key differences between Y-86 and x86 are:

### Subset of instructions 
- Y-86 includes a smaller set of instructions compared to x86, making it easier to learn and understand.
- Reduced addressing modes: Y-86 has fewer addressing modes compared to x86, simplifying memory access and data manipulation.
- Simplified registers: Y-86 has a smaller number of registers, reducing the complexity of register management.
- No support for floating-point operations: Y-86 does not include support for floating-point arithmetic, as it is focused on integer operations.
- Simplified pipeline: The Y-86 processor pipeline is less complex than the x86 pipeline, which allows for a more straightforward understanding of processor execution.

Despite these differences, Y-86 is still a powerful tool for understanding the fundamentals of computer architecture and assembly language programming, as it retains the essential concepts found in the x86 ISA.
